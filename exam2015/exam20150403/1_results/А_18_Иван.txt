Write the queries from point 3 in a file called inserts.sql

4. Answer the following question

Article_46_part1 containing created_on
Article_46_part2 containing all the other fields

As a result SQL query must be created
Write the queries from points 8 in a file called selects2.sql

9. Draw a picture of the database

Create a zip from this folder and name the zip FirstName_LastName_Class_Number.zip
(here FirstName is your first name, LastName is your last name, class is A or B and Number is your number in class)

Good luck and may the force be with you!
